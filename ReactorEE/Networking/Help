gamestate listener: runs on Player 2's machine. Messages should be sent from Player 1.
					Recommended to send messages from Player 1's game loop to ensure frequent Player 2 GUI updates.
sabotage listener: runs on Player 1's machine. Messages should be sent from Player 2.
					Recommended to send messages directly from .onClick() events.




Once handshaking is successful, the game will be initialised and the IPv4 of the
other computer passed to the respective game initialisers. This is represented in
the example as the variable clientIP.

To send a message to the sabotage listener:
		Message.run("Component to Fail", clientIP, 9003)
		
To send a message to the gamestate listener:
		Message.run("Serialised Game State", clientIP, 9004)
		



The listener classes are initialised at handshake and will run in the background
throughout the duration of the game to receive asynchronously. These classes are killed
only after receiving a set message, which should be sent on closing a 2 player game.

To end the sabotage listener:
		message.run("ANCHOVY KILL", clientIP, 9003)
		
To send the gamestate listener:
		message.run("ANCHOVY KILL", clientIP, 9004)
