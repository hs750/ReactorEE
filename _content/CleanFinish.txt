Our emphasis on familiar technologies means that you don’t have to learn an obscure Graphics Engine to continue development. Instead, a basic understanding of Java.AWT, Google Sketchup and Photoshop is all you need!

With minimalized yet striking animation, simplicity remains at the heart of everything that Anchovy does. Save time with the technologies you know and inherit our breath taking yet manageable display.
